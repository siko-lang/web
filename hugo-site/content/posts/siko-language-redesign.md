title = 'Siko language redesign'
+++

For those who encountered Siko before and for some reason still remember it, you may have noticed that the
language has undergone some significant changes.
The goal of this redesign is to improve usability, performance, and overall developer experience.
Both visually and semantically, the language is now an imperative language.

```siko
module Main {

fn main() {
  println("Hello, Siko!");
}

}
