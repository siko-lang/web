Concurrency primitives and patterns for parallel execution.

## Placeholder Documentation

This section is under development. Siko's concurrency features will include:

- Thread-based parallelism
- Message passing
- Shared memory with synchronization
- Lock-free data structures

## Basic Concepts

```siko
// Example syntax (subject to change)

fn parallel_task() {
  // Concurrent work
}
```

## Safety

Siko's ownership system provides:
- Data race prevention at compile time
- Thread-safe sharing through types
- No undefined behavior in concurrent code

More documentation coming soon!
