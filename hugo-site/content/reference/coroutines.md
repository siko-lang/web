Coroutines provide lightweight concurrency primitives for cooperative multitasking.

## Placeholder Documentation

This section is under development. Coroutines in Siko will provide:

- Lightweight concurrent tasks
- Cooperative scheduling
- Efficient context switching
- Integration with effect handlers

## Basic Concept

```siko
// Example syntax (subject to change)

coroutine fn my_coroutine() {
  yield();
  // more work
}
```

## Use Cases

Coroutines are ideal for:
- Async I/O operations
- State machines
- Generators and iterators
- Cooperative task scheduling

More documentation coming soon!
